ÄInvokes an event in the Bukkit plugin framework, allowing plugins to react to specific occurrences within the game environment.
1org.bukkit.plugin.SimplePluginManager.callEvent()
ˇ
‡These threads are used by Bukkit plugins to run asynchronous tasks. Usually processing done within these tasks does not affect the game/server performance too much, as long as the overall system is not low on CPU resources.
"Craft Scheduler Thread.*
û
cTemporarily suspends a part of the program until further action, typically for internal processes.
sun.misc.Unsafe.park()jdk.internal.misc.Unsafe.park()
ﬂ
éCauses the program to pause execution for a specified duration. While paused, no processing is taking place.
Context is required to understand whether this is good or bad. If the program is "busy waiting" for another thing to happen (e.g. another Thread to do something or an I/O operation), it may cause the program to slow down. In other cases, (e.g. if seen at the root of the Minecraft server tick loop), it is probably good news! See the [tick loop guide](https://spark.lucko.me/docs/guides/The-tick-loop) for more info.
java.lang.Thread.sleep()2java.util.concurrent.locks.LockSupport.parkNanos()
Æ
ìMarks the starting point of execution for a particular part of the program. The first child node will usually always be this, just keep expanding!
java.lang.Thread.run()
ß
ïThe main server thread that the game loop is executed on. See the [Tick Loop guide](https://spark.lucko.me/docs/guides/The-tick-loop) for more info.
"Server thread
ã
+The root of the Minecraft server activity.

Ñ
êUsually, this is the server "sleeping" (waiting to process the next game tick). Sometimes this section is also used to execute scheduled tasks.
8net.minecraft.server.MinecraftServer.waitUntilNextTick()5net.minecraft.server.IAsyncTaskHandler.sleepForTick()

LPauses the server briefly until the pending background tasks are completed.

/net.minecraft.world.ticks.TickListServer.tick()
∂
yHandles the update process for entities within a Minecraft world, excluding those that are passengers on other entities.
9net.minecraft.server.level.WorldServer.tickNonPassenger()
π
zControls the update process for chunks within the Minecraft server, ensuring they remain loaded and updated as necessary.
;net.minecraft.server.level.ChunkProviderServer.tickChunks()
∑
ÇManages the update process for player-related chunks within the Minecraft server, ensuring they are loaded and updated correctly.
0net.minecraft.server.level.PlayerChunkMap.tick()
∏
ÅHandles the update process for a specific chunk within a Minecraft world, ensuring its contents remain synchronized and updated.
2net.minecraft.server.level.WorldServer.tickChunk()
”
éManages the update process for pathfinding goals for entities in the Minecraft world, ensuring they behave according to their assigned goals.
@net.minecraft.world.entity.ai.goal.PathfinderGoalSelector.tick()

nControls the ongoing update process for the server's network connection, managing incoming and outgoing data.
4net.minecraft.server.network.ServerConnection.tick()
¢
sManages the network communication within the Minecraft server, handling the sending and receiving of data packets.
+net.minecraft.network.NetworkManager.tick()
¨
hHandles player movement events within the server, ensuring that player positions are updated correctly.
@net.minecraft.server.network.PlayerConnection.handleMovePlayer()
≥
tSends updates and changes to tracked entities within the Minecraft server to synchronize their states with clients.
;net.minecraft.server.level.EntityTrackerEntry.sendChanges()
